# Malady
## A cancer progression simulation
An adaptation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life simulation, Malady introduces the potential for a cell to mutate. And when conditions are right, mutant cells exhibit some hallmark cancer traits, like aggressive, sustained proliferation and a resistance to natural death.

As a discerning immune system, you must try to keep the light alive by clicking on mutant cells to kill them before they spread. But be careful: you can kill healthy cells as well. Killing too many healthy cells enhances disease progression.
