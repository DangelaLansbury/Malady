## A cancer progression simulation
An adaptation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life simulation, MALADY introduces the potential for a cell to mutate. And when conditions are right, mutant cells exhibit some hallmark cancer properties, like aggressive, sustained proliferation and a resistance to natural cell death. As the disease spreads, the light fades.

You, as a discerning immune system, must try to keep the light alive by clicking on mutant cells to kill them before they spread. But be careful: you can kill healthy cells as well. Killing too many healthy cells enhances disease progression. You may always press any key to restart.
